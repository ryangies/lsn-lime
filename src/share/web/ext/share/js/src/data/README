This is a refactor of of the code in ../filesystem because
we want a more abstract sense of things (not just the filesystem).

However, we still will design to the data members being js.hubb
built objects.

A bigger refactor is to bring js.hubb over here.

Why, because we would like:

  a) to build hub objects which are not contiguous (such as a
     query or module result)

  b) to build hub objects from json (rather than a req/resp)

All that being said, maybe it is a better idea to put this code
into js.hubb.

The kicker is this Schema and SchemaLoader stuff. Brought in
from the collections project. I imagine it would be nice if the
hub objects themselves had a getSchema method.
